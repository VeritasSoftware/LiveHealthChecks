An Asp Net Core Web Api/App has a [**Health Checks**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-6.0) system built into it.

This project taps into that system & makes the generated [**Health Report**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.diagnostics.healthchecks.healthreport?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0),

available to Monitoring applications, in real-time.

This **Client package** is added to the Asp Net Core Web API/App to be monitored.
